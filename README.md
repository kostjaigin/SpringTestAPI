# SpringTestAPI
My Java-Spring Playgrounds: API experiments, security tunings and other sandbox games.

I found this very interesting and helpful tutorials that highlighted the spring framework for me:

1. [REST API: Java Spring Boot and MongoDB](https://medium.com/@gtommee97/rest-api-java-spring-boot-and-mongodb-4dffbcabbaf5)
2. [REST Authentication with Spring Security and MongoDB](https://medium.com/@gtommee97/rest-authentication-with-spring-security-and-mongodb-28c06da25fb1)

In these tutorials Thomas Gleason covers basic questions about Spring Framework and explains how you could build your own API Service.
